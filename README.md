# Random projects
Though projects is putting it nicely. These are random little things I've worked on and either completed or abandoned.

Some good, working things that I use today include:

- **music_compare**: A script that trawls my media server and checks against local changes, and then lines them up to be added automatically to iTunes. It keeps a local record because iTunes butchers filenames, being why we can't just use something like BitTorrent Sync.
- **unimelbSubjectLinker**: A script that takes unimelb subject codes and names and produces a webpage linking to their handbook entries.

It is worth mentioning that most of these projects, if working, are not created extensibly and will not work outside of their original use case.
