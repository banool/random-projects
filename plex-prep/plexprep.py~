"""
with the greatest case of there being a folder with the movie inside it
as well as a bunch of other files
rename the folder and the movie file to be the same, then create a folder by
this name in the Movies folder and copy in the movie file
(there may be a sample file, in this case only rename and move the biggest file)
as such all superfluous shit will be left behind).
maybe also copy in any images (for artwork).
 

 

 

need a way to check inside the folder to decide if it is a tv show or a movie.
 

maybe just check the files and then ditch the old folders, instead making
new folders based off the name of the series.
if the shows inside have different naming schemes, maybe give the option to
choose which name you want to go for.
 

this will require a scanning phase and then a doing phase, though that was
always expected
 

 

 

does os walk go in to a folder first as deep as possible then recurses out?
maybe record the second up folder in a variable

prioritise file name and then the folder that it is in
