Probs need python 2.7 installed for this to work, 32 bit version I think.
Tried compiling into an .exe but that didn't work out too well.

Hopefully the external module "requests" shouldn't have to be installed since it is right here, but
if it throws errors about request.get then that'll be it.
You have to move those two requests folders in here to your python installation, probably:
C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages

Run using that batch file

kk sweeeeeet

btw if you want to see the actual code, right click on riot api stat test.py (not .pyc) and then
edit it with notepad (or IDLE if you have python installed).
